This is the source repository for my [CV](http://sethwalker.github.com/cv).

It's valid HTML5 and CSS2.1.  It has a decent print stylesheet, and also looks good with no style.  There's even a bit of [hResume](http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume) sprinkled in.

It's built on top of the [Blueprint CSS](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) framework, with PDFs generated with [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/).
